Someday I want this to be an app that can notate music directly from audio to sheet music! I got a lot to learn, but eventually it'll get there.
I would like to combine some kind of pitch recognition and notation software to give musician's like myself a space to put there ideas directly from instrument 
to paper, without the need of notating
